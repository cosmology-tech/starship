# Feature Toggles

Starship allows you to have toggles for some additional
services to run with your infra setup. A few of them are
mentioned bellow.

## Registry

Following the schema of the `cosmos/chain-registry` repos,
if enabled this service spins up a rest api chain-registry service
for the infra you spin up.

### Syntax

```yaml
registry:
  enabled: true  # enable registry service
  ports:
    rest: 8081   # localhost port for redirecting traffic
  # Optional: resources directive, defualt cpu: 0.2, memory: 200M
  resources:
    cpu: 0.5
    memory: 200M
  # Optional: image directive, default image:ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/registry:20230614-7173db2
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/registry:20230614-7173db2
```

### Usage

Here is a list of avialable endpoints and how to use them:

| Endpoint                      | Returns
| ----------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `/chain_ids`                  | List of all chain-ids in the current setup
|`/chains`                      | List of all chain items
| `/chains/{chain}`             | Chain schema for the given chain ids (`name` in the `chains` directive)
| `/chains/{chain}/assets`      | Assets of the given chain
| `/chains/{chain}/keys`        | List of mnemonics used for the setup
| `/ibc`                        | List all ibc info for all chains
| `/ibc/{chain_1}/{chain_2}`    | IBC information between the 2 chains specified

Proto defination for the service is [here]()

## Explorer
Inorder to provide a full fleged emulation environment, we have
a handy toggle to spin up an explorer for the infra.

Currently we support only Ping Pub explorer, but we will be adding more

### Syntax

```yaml
explorer:
  enabled: true  # enable registry service
  type: ping-pub # currently only support for ping-pub explorer
  ports:
    rest: 8080   # localhost port for redirecting traffic
  # Optional: resources directive, defualt cpu: 1, memory: 2Gi
  resources:
    cpu: 2
    memory: 4Gi
  # Optional: image directive, default image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/ping-pub:6b7b0d096946b6bcd75d15350c7345da0d4576db
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/ping-pub:6b7b0d096946b6bcd75d15350c7345da0d4576db
```

Available versions for the explorer can be found [here]()

### Usage

After performing `port-forward`, open explorer at: http://localhost:8080
