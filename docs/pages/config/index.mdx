# Configuration

In Starship one can define the infra required with a simple config file.
The config file one specifies is merged with the default [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/blob/main/starship/charts/devnet/values.yaml)
file before the infra is spun up. All supported directives are present in the default `values.yaml`. We will go over most used ones here.

Here is a basic example that will spin up:
* 2 chains with 2 validators each
* Hermes relayer between them (by default will create the IBC-transfer ports and channels)
* Explorer instance: ping-pub with the 2 chains configuration
* Registry service: Analogous to cosmos/chain-registry, following the same schemas

```yaml
name: starship
version: v0.2.6

chains:
  - id: osmosis-1
    name: osmosis
    numValidators: 2
    ports:
      rest: 1313
      rpc: 26653
  - id: gaia-1
    name: cosmoshub
    numValidators: 2
    ports:
      rest: 1317
      rpc: 26657

relayers:
  - name: osmos-gaia
    type: hermes
    replicas: 1
    chains:
      - osmosis-1
      - gaia-1

explorer:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    rest: 8080

registry:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    rest: 8081
```

Note this is a basic configuration file. We have various other directives and operations we can perform just with
the config file directives that we will go into details into.
