Starship is a unified development environment that allows Cosmos developers to spin up a fully simulated mini-cosmos ecosystem
and write end-to-end test cases


Go to the [Official Project](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship) (üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èin progress...).

## Quick Start Guide
### Prerequisites
To get started, you'll need:
* Kubernetes setup (recommended: Docker Desktop with Kubernetes support for local setups): [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* `kubectl`: [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* `helm`: [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

For further information, refer to the [Starship Documentation](https://docs.cosmology.zone/starship/get-started/step-2) on Kubernetes setup and configuration.

### Install
Install the CLI @starship-ci/cli:

```bash
npm install -g @starship-ci/cli
```


### Configuration
To configure Starship for multichain support, create a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`).
Here‚Äôs a sample configuration:

```yaml
name: starship-localnet
version: 0.2.20

chains:
- id: osmosis-1
  name: osmosis
  numValidators: 2
  ports:
    rest: 1313
    rpc: 26653
    faucet: 8003
- id: cosmoshub-4
  name: cosmoshub
  numValidators: 2
  ports:
    rest: 1317
    rpc: 26657
    faucet: 8007

relayers:
- name: osmos-cosmos
  type: hermes
  replicas: 1
  chains:
    - osmosis-1
    - cosmoshub-4

explorer:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    rest: 8080

registry:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    rest: 8081
```

For more details on the configuration options and directives available, refer to the [Starship Config](https://docs.cosmology.zone/starship/config).

### Running Starship

#### Deploying üöÄ

```sh
yarn starship start --config config.yaml
```

#### Teardown üõ†Ô∏è

```sh
# stop ports and delete deployment
yarn starship stop --config config.yaml
```

## Who is using Starship?

### [Cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tests/starship)

Cosmos-SDK is running Starship for testing out the latest simapp. Runs in [CI/CD](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/actions/workflows/starship-tests.yml)

### [Agoric SDK](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/multichain-testing)

Agoric SDK is using Starship to run end-to-end tests for Agoric chain. Runs in CI/CD.
Running 4 chains and relayers between them, then using JS based custom e2e testing system that they built.
### [Mesh-Security](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/mesh-security-sdk/tree/main/tests/starship)

For mesh-security development, Starship is being used to create a dev environment in a cloud cluster to
run 2 chains and a relayer, setup mesh-security contracts between them, as well as spin up mesh-security frontend as well.
### [OsmoJS](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/pull/36)

JS library using Starship to run end-to-end tests against Osmosis chain. (Run in CI/CD)
### [persistenceCore](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/pull/198)

Persistence Core chain using Starship to test chain upgrades. (Run in CI/CD)

## Examples

### [CosmJS based e2e testing](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/tree/main/examples/osmojs)

Setup chain multiple chains, write e2e tests for governance, staking and osmosis specific txns.
Run tests with JS using CosmJS.
Run tests with Golang
### [Chain Upgrade E2E test](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/tree/main/examples/upgrade-test)

Setup chain with cosmovisor setup with different chain version binaries.
Run tests with Golang
### [Multi chain setup](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/blob/main/examples/multi-chain/config.yaml)

Multi chain setup with 3 chains, 2 relayers between the chain, explorer and registry
