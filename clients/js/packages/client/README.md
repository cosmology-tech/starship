**StarshipJS** is the JS companion to deploy and manage [Starship](https://cosmology.zone/products/starship), tailored specifically for Node.js and TypeScript developers. This toolkit provides a seamless, easy-to-use interface that dramatically simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of interchain applications, whether on your local machine or CI/CD environments.

Designed with simplicity and speed in mind, **StarshipJS** enables developers to quickly integrate Starship into their blockchain projects without complex orchestration.

## Features

👨🏻‍💻 **Node.js and TypeScript Focused**: Tailored specifically for JavaScript ecosystems, **StarshipJS** brings simplicity to multi-chain development for Node.js and TypeScript environments, streamlining the setup and coding processes.

🚀 **Simplified Interchain Development**: Enables the straightforward creation of applications that span multiple blockchain networks. This simplifies complex blockchain interactions, enhancing interoperability and making it easier to build sophisticated interchain solutions.

🔒 **Security-First Approach**: **StarshipJS** incorporates security best practices from the ground up. Facilitates secure coding practices and configurations, helping developers build secure blockchain applications by default, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

## Install

Install the test utilities library, `@starship-ci/client` with `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
npm install @starship-ci/client
```

### Recommended Usage 📘

Stay tuned for a `create-cosmos-app` boilerplate! For now, this is the most recommended setup. Consider everything else after this section "advanced setup".

- We recommend studying the [osmojs starship integration](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs/starship) and replicating it.
- Add your configs, similar to how it's done [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs/starship/configs)
- Add your workflows for GitHub Actions [like this](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yaml)
- Add `yarn starship` commands to your package.json scripts [like this](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/c456184666eda55cd6fee5cd09ba6c05c898d55c/packages/osmojs/package.json#L31-L34)
— Note the jest configurations in the [osmojs package](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs)


This will allow you to run `yarn starship` to `start`, `setup`, `deploy`, `stop` and other `starship` commands:

#### Deploying `Starship` 🚀

```sh
yarn starship start

# sanity check
yarn starship get-pods
```

#### Running End-to-End Tests 🧪

```sh
# test
yarn starship:test

# watch 
yarn starship:watch
```

#### Teardown 🛠️

```sh
# stop ports and delete deployment
yarn starship stop
```

## Advanced Usage 

### Manual setup

Instead of using `yarn starship start`, you can also to each step, and do checks in between:

```sh
# setup helm/starship
yarn starship setup

# sanity check
yarn starship get-pods

# deploy starship
yarn starship deploy

# wait til STATUS=Running
yarn starship get-pods

# port forwarding
yarn starship start-ports

# check pids
yarn starship port-pids
```

The `StarshipClient` simplifies managing Kubernetes resources, specifically tailored for developers working in interchain environments. Below is an example showing how to instantiate the client and use it to manage a Helm deployment:

### Initializing the Client

First, you need to import and initialize the `StarshipClient` with your Helm configuration:

```js
import {StarshipClient} from '@starship-ci/client';

const client = new StarshipClient({
  name: 'osmojs',
  config: 'path/to/config.yaml',
  repo: 'starship',
  repoUrl: 'https://hyperweb-io.github.io/starship/',
  chart: 'devnet',
  version: 'v0.2.3'
});
```

### Configuration

After initializing, you can load in your config. Assuming you have a `yaml` file:

```js
client.loadConfig();
```

If you don't have one, you can set and save a configuration directly from the client:

```js
client.setConfig(config);
client.saveConfig(config);
```

### Setting Up and Installing the Chart

After initializing, set up the environment and install the starship helm chart:

```js
// adds helm chart to registry
client.setup();
// installs helm chart
client.deploy();
```

### Starting Port Forwarding

For local development, you might need to forward ports from your Kubernetes pods:

```js
client.startPortForward();
```

### Stopping and Cleaning Up

Once done with development or testing, you can stop the port forwarding and remove the Helm chart:

```js
// stop port forwarding
// remove the deployed release from your Kubernetes cluster
client.undeploy();

// remove the helm chart
client.teardown();
```

## Developing


When first cloning the repo:
```
yarn
yarn build
```
