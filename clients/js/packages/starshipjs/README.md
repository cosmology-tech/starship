**StarshipJS** is the JS companion to deploy and manage [Starship](https://cosmology.zone/products/starship), tailored specifically for Node.js and TypeScript developers. This toolkit provides a seamless, easy-to-use interface that dramatically simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of interchain applications, whether on your local machine or CI/CD environments.

Designed with simplicity and speed in mind, **StarshipJS** enables developers to quickly integrate Starship into their blockchain projects without complex orchestration.

## Features

üë®üèª‚Äçüíª **Node.js and TypeScript Focused**: Tailored specifically for JavaScript ecosystems, **StarshipJS** brings simplicity to multi-chain development for Node.js and TypeScript environments, streamlining the setup and coding processes.

üöÄ **Simplified Interchain Development**: Enables the straightforward creation of applications that span multiple blockchain networks. This simplifies complex blockchain interactions, enhancing interoperability and making it easier to build sophisticated interchain solutions.

üîí **Security-First Approach**: **StarshipJS** incorporates security best practices from the ground up. Facilitates secure coding practices and configurations, helping developers build secure blockchain applications by default, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

## Install

Install the test utilities `starshipjs`:

```sh
npm install starshipjs
```

## Using with CI/CD

NOTE: Before you code! You'll want to use the CLI tool ([`@starship-ci/cli`](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/tree/main/clients/js/packages/cli)) in a package.json to get starship working.

### Install the packages

Install `@starship-ci/cli` and `starshipjs`

```sh
yarn add --dev starshipjs @starship-ci/cli
```

Add your configuration files, similar to these:

- [Example `config.yaml`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/main/packages/osmojs/starship/configs/config.yaml)

- [Example `starship.yaml`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/main/packages/osmojs/starship/configs/starship.yaml)

- [Example `jest.config.js`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/main/packages/osmojs/jest.starship.config.js)


### Update your `package.json` `scripts`:

```json
"starship": "starship --config ./starship/configs/starship.yaml",
"starship:test": "jest --config ./jest.starship.config.js --verbose --bail",
"starship:watch": "jest --watch --config ./jest.starship.config.js"
```

See an [example here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/main/packages/osmojs/package.json).

### Start starship üöÄ

```sh
yarn starship start
```

### Manual setup & start

```sh
yarn starship setup
yarn starship deploy
yarn starship start-ports
```

### Stopping starship

```sh
yarn starship stop
```

## Using the Client

StarshipJS is a utility library that provides helpers to leverage [Starship](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship)'s internal chain registry, emulating the style of code used in projects like [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/cosmos-kit).

### Configuration

Before using StarshipJS, you need to set up the configuration for your blockchain network.

```js
import { ConfigContext } from 'starshipjs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Path to your YAML configuration file
const configFile = join(__dirname, 'your-config.yaml');

// using init for init the config and a default connected registry fetcher.
await ConfigContext.init(configFile);

```

### Registry

Using init for init the config and pass an optional customized registry fetcher.

```js
import { useRegistry, ConfigContext } from 'starshipjs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Path to your YAML configuration file
const configFile = join(__dirname, 'your-config.yaml');

const fetcher = new ChainRegistryFetcher({
  // your own options
});

await ConfigContext.init(configFile, fetcher);
```

Or use `useRegistry` to get a registry fetcher.

```js
import { useRegistry, ConfigContext } from 'starshipjs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Path to your YAML configuration file
const configFile = join(__dirname, 'your-config.yaml');

const fetcher = await useRegistry(configFile);

await ConfigContext.init(configFile, fetcher);
```

## Chain Info

Get detailed chain information about the blockchain network:

```js
const { chainInfo } = useChain('osmosis');

console.log(chainInfo);
```

## Credits and Faucets

If your blockchain network supports faucets, you can use them to get test tokens:

```js
const { creditFromFaucet } = useChain('osmosis');
const address = 'your-blockchain-address';

await creditFromFaucet(address);
```

## Developing


When first cloning the repo:
```
yarn
yarn build
```
