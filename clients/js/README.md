## Install

Install the test utilities `starshipjs` and the CI client `@starship-ci/client`:

```sh
npm install starshipjs @starship-ci/client
```

### Recommended Usage 📘

Stay tuned for a `create-cosmos-app` boilerplate! For now, this is the most recommended setup. Consider everything else after this section "advanced setup".

- We recommend studying the [osmojs starship integration](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs/starship) and replicating it.
- Add your configs, similar to how it's done [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs/starship/configs)
- Add your workflows for GitHub Actions [like this](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yaml)
- Add `yarn starship` commands to your package.json scripts [like this](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/c456184666eda55cd6fee5cd09ba6c05c898d55c/packages/osmojs/package.json#L31-L34)
— Note the jest configurations in the [osmojs package](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs)


This will allow you to run `yarn starship` to `start`, `setup`, `deploy`, `stop` and other `starship` commands:

#### Deploying `Starship` 🚀

```sh
yarn starship start
```

#### Running End-to-End Tests 🧪

```sh
# test
yarn starship:test

# watch
yarn starship:watch
```

#### Teardown 🛠️

```sh
# stop ports and delete deployment
yarn starship stop
```

## CLI Usage

See more usage in the [`StarshipJS CLI`](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/tree/main/clients/js/packages/cli) documentation.

### Install the CLI

While it's not recommended due to upgrades and package management, you can install globally:

```sh
npm install -g @starship-ci/cli
```

### Run starship

```sh
starship start --config ./config/settings.json
```

### Run starhip (manually)
```sh
starship setup --config ./config/settings.json
starship deploy --config ./config/settings.json
starship start-ports --config ./config/settings.json
```

### Teardown starship

```sh
starship undeploy --config ./config/settings.json
starship teardown --config ./config/settings.json
```

## StarshipClient Usage

See more info in the [`StarshipJS Client`](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/tree/main/clients/js/packages/client) documentation.

### Install the StarshipClient

Install the CI client `@starship-ci/client`:

```sh
npm install @starship-ci/client
```

### Initializing the Client

First, you need to import and initialize the `StarshipClient` with your Helm configuration:

```js
import {StarshipClient} from '@starship-ci/client';

const client = new StarshipClient({
  name: 'osmojs',
  config: 'path/to/config.yaml',
  repo: 'starship',
  repoUrl: 'https://hyperweb-io.github.io/starship/',
  chart: 'devnet',
  version: 'v0.2.3'
});
```

### Configuration

After initializing, you can load in your config. Assuming you have a `yaml` file:

```js
client.loadConfig();
```

If you don't have one, you can set and save a configuration directly from the client:

```js
client.setConfig(config);
client.saveConfig(config);
```

### Setting Up and Installing the Chart

After initializing, set up the environment and install the starship helm chart:

```js
// adds helm chart to registry
client.setup();
// installs helm chart
client.deploy();
```

### Starting Port Forwarding

For local development, you might need to forward ports from your Kubernetes pods:

```js
client.startPortForward();
```

### Stopping and Cleaning Up

Once done with development or testing, you can stop the port forwarding and remove the Helm chart:

```js
// stop port forwarding
// remove the deployed release from your Kubernetes cluster
client.undeploy();

// remove the helm chart
client.teardown();
```

## StarshipJS Usage

[`StarshipJS`](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship/tree/main/clients/js/packages/starshipjs) is a utility library that provides helpers to leverage [Starship](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/starship)'s internal chain registry, emulating the style of code used in projects like [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/cosmos-kit).

### StarshipJS Configuration

Before using StarshipJS, you need to set up the configuration for your blockchain network.

```js
import { ConfigContext } from 'starshipjs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Path to your YAML configuration file
const configFile = join(__dirname, 'your-config.yaml');

// using init for init the config and a default connected registry fetcher.
await ConfigContext.init(configFile);

```

### Registry

Using init for init the config and pass an optional customized registry fetcher.

```js
import { useRegistry, ConfigContext } from 'starshipjs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Path to your YAML configuration file
const configFile = join(__dirname, 'your-config.yaml');

const fetcher = new ChainRegistryFetcher({
  // your own options
});

await ConfigContext.init(configFile, fetcher);
```

Or use `useRegistry` to get a registry fetcher.

```js
import { useRegistry, ConfigContext } from 'starshipjs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Path to your YAML configuration file
const configFile = join(__dirname, 'your-config.yaml');

const fetcher = await useRegistry(configFile);

await ConfigContext.init(configFile, fetcher);
```

## Chain Info

Get detailed chain information about the blockchain network:

```js
const { chainInfo } = useChain('osmosis');

console.log(chainInfo);
```

## Credits and Faucets

If your blockchain network supports faucets, you can use them to get test tokens:

```js
const { creditFromFaucet } = useChain('osmosis');
const address = 'your-blockchain-address';

await creditFromFaucet(address);
```

## Developing


When first cloning the repo:
```
yarn
yarn build
```
